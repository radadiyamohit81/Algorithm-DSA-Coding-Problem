## What is Hacktoberfest? :thinking:
Hacktoberfest — brought to you by [DigitalOcean](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) in partnership with [GitHub](https://github.blog/2017-09-27-celebrate-open-source-this-october-with-hacktoberfest/) and [Intel](https://www.intel.in/) — is a month-long celebration of open source software. Maintainers are invited to guide would-be contributors towards resolving issues that will help move the project forward, and contributors get the opportunity to give back to both projects they like, and ones they've just discovered. **No contribution is too small** — bug fixes and documentation updates are valid ways of participating. Celebrated every month of October based on the German festivity Oktoberfest.

Hacktoberfest is *open to everyone* in the global community. Whether you’re a developer, student learning to code, event host, or company of any size, you can help drive growth of open source and make positive contributions to an [ever-growing community](https://github.com/open-source).
